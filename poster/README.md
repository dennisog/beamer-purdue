# Beamerposter Themes using Purdue University Colors

## What is this?

This subfolder holds some examples on how to design research posters using
Beamerposter and LaTeX with a strong Purdue flavor.

## How to use

Please check the example files `poster_example.tex` and `poster_example_2.tex`
on how to use the template file. This should be pretty straightforward. This
repository also contains the PDF output for these source files

## Licenses

The template file `beamerthemepurduegoldposter.sty` is available under the
[CC-BY license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)---do what you
want with them, as usual. Since the example posters and most of the figures
within cover actual my research, I decided to publish them under the [CC-BY-NC
license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), which means that
this cannot be remixed for commercial purposes. I did not attach a license to
the figures in the `figures/` directory on purpose, these are to be used as
examples only, although some of them were found on <https://openclipart.org/>
